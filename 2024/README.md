# Advent of Code 2024

The language of the year will be Python and C as a backup. Hoping to just have some fun and solve the puzzles this year. Maybe I'll go back and re-solve all the puzzles with a new language!

Running test for a day (ensure you `sudo apt-get install pandoc`):

```
Usage: ./run_tests.sh <subfolder to execute> [-h | -c "cookie_val"][-f][-y <year_num>]
        -h print help
        -c input new cookie
        -f force update
        -y year number

Example 1: ./run_tests.sh Day1 -c mySecret_C00K13
Example 2: ./run_tests.sh 1
```

## Improvements from Previous Years

TBD
